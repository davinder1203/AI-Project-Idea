# Smart Road Safety Assistant  
**Building AI course project**

## Summary
Smart Road Safety Assistant is an AI-based system that detects traffic rule violations and accident-prone situations using video data and machine learning. The goal is to improve road safety by enabling faster response, awareness, and data-driven decision-making for authorities and citizens.

## Background
Road accidents and traffic rule violations are among the leading causes of injuries and deaths in urban areas. Many violations such as helmetless riding, overspeeding, or wrong-lane driving go unnoticed due to limited monitoring resources.

I am motivated by seeing frequent unsafe driving behavior around me. Improving road safety is important because timely detection and prevention can save lives, reduce congestion, and improve public wellbeing.

## Data sources and AI methods
The system uses traffic CCTV video footage and open traffic datasets. Key AI techniques include:
* Computer Vision (object detection and tracking)
* Supervised learning (classification of violations)
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Python, OpenCV, YOLO

## How is it used?
1. Video feeds from road cameras are processed in real time.
2. Violations such as speeding or no helmets are detected automatically.
3. Alerts are sent to traffic authorities and emergency services.
4. A dashboard visualizes incidents and trends over time.

This solution is used by:
* Traffic police
* City planners
* Emergency responders

## Challenges
This project does not guarantee perfect detection:
* Accuracy depends on camera quality and lighting.
* Weather and occlusion can reduce performance.
* Privacy and ethics must be considered carefully.

## What next?
Future improvements could include:
* Integration with emergency services
* Predictive risk analysis
* Mobile alerts for citizens
* Improved data collection and labeling

## Acknowledgments
* Inspired by traffic safety research and smart city AI projects
* Uses open source tools such as Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow
* Built as part of the Elements of AI “Building AI” course
