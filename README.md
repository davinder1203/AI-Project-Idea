Smart Road Safety Assistant

Building AI course project

Summary

Smart Road Safety Assistant is an AI-based system that detects traffic rule violations and accident-prone situations using video data and machine learning. The goal is to improve road safety by enabling faster response, awareness, and data-driven decision-making for authorities and citizens.

Background

Road accidents and traffic rule violations are among the leading causes of injuries and deaths, especially in urban and semi-urban areas. Many violations such as helmetless riding, overspeeding, or wrong-lane driving go unnoticed due to limited monitoring resources.

Personally, I am motivated by seeing frequent accidents and unsafe driving behavior around me. This problem is important because timely detection and prevention can save lives, reduce congestion, and improve overall public safety.

Problems addressed:

Delayed accident detection

Manual traffic monitoring limitations

Lack of real-time alerts

Poor use of existing CCTV data

How is it used?

The system is designed to work with existing road-side CCTV cameras.

Video streams are collected from traffic cameras.

AI models analyze the video in real time.

Violations or accident-like events are detected automatically.

Alerts are generated for authorities or emergency services.

Data dashboards help in long-term planning and policy decisions.

Users affected:

Traffic police

Emergency responders

City planners

General public (indirectly)

The solution can be used continuously in urban environments with minimal human intervention.

Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:

Traffic CCTV video footage

Public datasets for vehicles and pedestrians

Open datasets for road accident analysis

AI methods used:

Computer Vision (object detection and tracking)

Supervised learning for violation classification

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Simple rule-based logic combined with ML

Optional use of cloud services for scalability

Example technologies:

YOLO for object detection

OpenCV for video processing

Python for implementation

Challenges

This project does not solve all problems related to road safety.

Limitations include:

Accuracy depends on camera quality and lighting

Weather conditions may affect detection

Privacy and surveillance concerns

Bias in data if training data is limited

Ethical considerations such as data privacy and responsible AI usage must be carefully handled.

What next?

Future improvements could include:

Integration with emergency services

Predictive accident risk analysis

Mobile app notifications for citizens

Better anonymization for privacy

Expansion to smart city platforms

To move forward, the project would need:

More real-world data

Collaboration with authorities

Stronger computing infrastructure

Legal and ethical reviews
